What are the benefits of using Object Oriented Programming in Ruby? Think of as many as you can.

- You can organize code in a hierarchical structure of superclasses and subclasses, letting
classes inherit methods from other classes.
- You can define modules that can be included in different classes.
- You can create multiple objects of the same class without writing reduntant code.
- You can define relationships between classes in a way that corresponds to their real
  world relationships.
